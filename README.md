# Logistic-Regression-using-Python

For my workshops, I have build a couple of Logistic Regression models on an Advertising data set and Heart Disease data.

For advertising data, I classified users who have a high chance of clicking on an advertisement. I build a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of individual users.
For Disease data, I classified individuals who are at a high risk of getting a disease based on their medical history.

**Exploring the Data:**
* Checking for null values
* Exploring target variable
* Understanding distribution of different numerical variables

**Logistic Regression Model:**
* Creating list of Independent and Dependent variables
* Splitting data into training and testing data sets (70-30%)
* Fitting the model

**Model Evaluation:**
* Confusion Matrix
* Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity
* Classification Report
* AUC-ROC Curve

Later, I performed **K-fold cross validation** to improve both the models.
